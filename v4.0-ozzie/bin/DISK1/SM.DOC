            Introduction

                 The  Session  Manager(SM)    for  Multi-Tasking  MS-DOS
            allows you  to run up to six programs at one time and switch
            between them  with a  couple of  keystrokes.  Each program's
            screen is  preserved so  that it  can be  restored when  you
            switch back  to it.  SM also contains the system-wide, Int24
            Handler.


            Initialization

                 The first  thing SM does when it is started is look for
            any program  initialization information  you may  have.   SM
            looks for  the initialization  information in  a file  named
            SM.INI in  the current  directory.  Although recommended, no
            initialization information is needed.

            There are two types of initialization lines:
                 1)   define <program key> <program name> [program args]
                      <working directory>
                 2)   start  <program key>

                 "program key"  - a printable ascii character, a control
                           character (^A thru ^^), or a function key (F1
                           - F10).
                 "working directory"  - a well formed path; i.e., begins
                           with drive letter (d:\).

                 Each define  line will  associate a key with a program.
            If there  is more  than one  define line using the same key,
            only the information in the last one is used.

                 A start  line is  optional.  If one exists, the program
            associated with  the key on the start line is run as soon as
            SM finishes  initializing.   If more  than one start line is
            given, the last one is used.

            This is what a sample initialization file might look like:

                      define f1 a:\command.com c:\bin\src
                      define ^z z.exe foo.c a:\foo\bar
                      start f1


            Running the Session Manager

                 To run  Session Manager,  just type  SM.   It does  not
            require any  arguments.   If there  was a  start line in the








     Session Manager User's Guide - Page: 2

            initialization file,  the program  associated with the start
            key will be run.  Otherwise, the SM screen will be displayed
            and you will be prompted for input.

                 The SM  screen contains  a chart  that  describes  each
            defined  program's   key,  status,  arguments,  and  working
            directory.  There are 3 types of program status:

                      1)   New - the program has never been run.
                      2)   Active - the program has been started.
                      3)   Dead - the program has terminated.

                 The input  choices at  this point  are to either type a
            program key  or hit  the <ESC> button to enter command mode.
            If you  hit a  program key,  the screen associated with that
            program   will   be   displayed   and   the   program   will
            start/continue executing.   If  this is  the first  time the
            program has  been run,  a chdir  to  the  program's  working
            directory is  made before it is started.  If SM cannot start
            the program you desired, the SM screen will reappear.

                 If the  program you  chose to  run has died, its screen
            will still  be displayed  so that  you can check its output.
            That is  all you  can do  while in  a dead  programs  screen
            except switch back to SM.

                 To  switch  back  to  SM,  hit  Alt-F10.    Alt-F10  is
            currently the  program key  for SM and will be recognized no
            matter what  other programs  are running.   This is the only
            program key  that works  this way.   All  of the others will
            only be  recognized if  SM is  running and  the SM screen is
            being displayed.

                 Whenever any  of SM's  children die,  their  status  is
            changed to  dead.   You will  see the status change the next
            time the  SM screen  is displayed.  If the program using the
            current screen dies, you will go back into SM.


            Command Mode

            When you  enter SM's  command mode the prompt "SM command or
            HELP>" is displayed.  The valid SM commands are:

                 1)   INIT <program key>
                      Initialize the program associated with key so that
                      it can  be run  again.   The program's  status  is
                      changed to  "New" and  its screen memory is freed.
                      If the   program is active, it is killed before it
                      is initialized.

                 2)   DEFINE <program key> <program name> [program args]
                      <working directory>
                      Define and  run a  new program  using the supplied
                      information.   If the  key was previously defined,
                      redefine it.

                 3)   RUN <program key>
                      Run the program associated with key.

                 4)   RESTART <program key>
                      Restart the  program associated  with key.    This
                      like issuing an INIT and a RUN command.

                 5)   KILL <program key>
                      Kill the  program associated with key.  Its status
                      is changed to dead.

                 6) HELP
                      Display a help screen.

                 7)   EXIT
                      Kill all of SM's children and exit SM.

                 In all  of the  above commands,  "key" is the printable
            ascii representation of a programs key.  If a command fails,
            you will either be asked to enter a new command or placed in
            SM's top level.


            Session Manager's Int24 Handler

                 Whenever an Int24 occurs, SM's Int24 handler is called.
            No matter  what program  is using  the screen  and no matter
            which program  caused the error, SM's Int24 screen is always
            displayed.  This screen will contain information on the type
            of Int24  that happened, and the name and pid of the program
            that caused the error.  You will then be prompted for one of
            the valid  actions for this type of error.  After the action
            typed in  has been taken, you are returned to the screen you
            were using before the Int24.

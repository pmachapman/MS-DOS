The object files given here are sufficient to create the BIOS
for the IBM system.  Some sources are given as examples for
OEM supplied device drivers.  These sources do not necessarily
implement all the features described in the device driver
documentation.  They have evolved in parallel with the
documentation, so some features described in the documentation
may not yet be present in the drivers.  Below is a summary of
the files supplied:

	read_me		This file.
	ibmbio.asm	Main body of the BIOS.
	ibmdsk.asm	Floppy and Hard disk drivers.
	ibmmtcon.asm	Multi-screen console driver.
	ansi.inc	ANSI X3.64 terminal emulation.
	bugcode.inc	Module which implements debugging
			prints.  The routine PUTC must be
			modified for other devices.  See
			also the file DEFDBUG.INC.
	sys*.obj	The SYSINIT program.  No source supplied.
	biosobj.mak	Contains instructions for building the
			IBM BIOS.
	bootpach.exe	Modifies a V2.0 boot sector (on A:) for
			the IBM to accomodate the larger BIOS.

                               Beta Test Release 1.00

            ARENA.EXE - Prints out arena assignments

                 arena

                      The system's  memory arena  is printed  out.   The
                      number listed  under the owner field is the PID of
                      the process which owns the memory.


            BBSET.EXE - Set and report on behavior bits

                 bbset [-o] [ {+|-}bitname ... ] fname ...

                      BBSET sets or clears behavior bits in an .EXE file
                      header.   Multi-Tasking MS-DOS  uses the  behavior
                      bits   to   determine   the   level   of   special
                      compatibility   support    needed   to   run   the
                      application.

                      BBSET will  set  (if  +bitname)  or  clear  (if  -
                      bitname)  the   named  behavior  bit(s)  from  the
                      specified files.   If  the -o switch is specified,
                      BBSET writes  a report  on the  current setting of
                      all the  defined behavior  bits  to  stdout  after
                      making the requested changes.

                      For a  list of  behavior  bits  that  BBSET  knows
                      about, type BBSET without any arguments.


            COUNTDOW.EXE - Count down a CPU loop

                 countdown number

                      Its argument  is a  number; it  counts the  number
                      down to 0, at about a 1hz rate.     It  prints out
                      the countdown.   Another  CPU  loop  program  like
                      TEXT, but  this  one  terminates  when  the  count
                      reaches 0


            DETACH.EXE - Detaches a child process

                 detach command [argument ...]

                      The command  given is run as a background process.
                      Detach prints  out the  Command Subgroup ID (CSID)
                      which may  be used  as  an  argument  to  KILL  to
                      terminate the process.

            HE_DAEM.EXE - Hard error catcher

                 detach he_daem

                      Intercepts hard  errors, reports them and requests
                      user action.   This  should always  be run  in the
                      background for now.  Put the above command line in
                      your AUTOEXEC.BAT  file if you're not going to use
                      the Session Manager (SM).


            KILL.EXE - send a signal to a process

                 kill [-nn] [sig=nn] [disp=mm] pid ...

                      Sends signal  nn with  disposition mm to processes
                      mentioned in pid.  Defaults to SIGTERM and process
                      tree disposition.


            POUND.EXE - Exercise disk I/O system

                 pound [t]count filea fileb

                      Pound reads  sequencially through filea and fileb,
                      reading 512  bytes at  a time  alternating between
                      the files  on each  read.  When the end of file is
                      read the  following read  for that  file begins at
                      the  beginning  of  the  file.    If  a  count  is
                      specified without  the preceeding  "t" then  pound
                      reads 512  bytes, count  number of times from each
                      file  before  the  program  terminates.    If  "t"
                      preceeds the  count value  then the files are read
                      for count  number of  seconds before  the  program
                      terminates.


            SLEEP.EXE - Sleep for a while

                 sleep sec[.millisec]

                      Sleep will  execute a  sleep system  call for  the
                      number  of  seconds  and  milliseconds  specified.
                      This might  be useful  in batch files to pause for
                      an interval  as opposed  to  waiting  for  a  user
                      response.


            SM.EXE - Session manager

                 sm

                      Manages multiple  processes running  on  different
                      screens.   Uses initialization  file SM.INI.  This

                      program includes  the hard error catcher, so don't
                      run HE_DAEM  if you're going to use this.  See the
                      file SM.DOC for more information.


            TEXT.EXE - Loop and print text

                 text argument

                      CPU loops  and prints  its argument  every  2  CPU
                      seconds or so
